RocketBlend Desktop is designed to elevate your [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) workflow by simplifying dependency management, and enhancing the discoverability of local projects.

It streamlines the management of Blender builds and addons, ensures smooth handling of project dependencies powered by [RocketBlend](https://github.com/rocketblend/rocketblend), and provides tools to efficiently organize and access your `.blend` projects. Project data is conveniently stored in `.yaml` files alongside your `.blend` files, enabling easy project sharing and synchronization.

> [!NOTE]  
> Important: RocketBlend Desktop is currently under active development and still evolving. As such, expect significant changes, potential bugs, and incomplete features. We recommend holding off on using it until it reaches a more stable release.

## Development Requirements

- [Golang 1.21.x](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [NodeJS 20.x.x](https://nodejs.org/en/) Recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) or [windows-nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades) to manage NodeJS versions.
- [Wails 2.7.1](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation#platform-specific-dependencies)
  - Then run `wails doctor` to ensure you have all the correct system-level dependencies installed.
- [Mage](https://magefile.org/)

### Developing Locally

To run in live development mode:

- `wails dev` in the project directory
  - This will run a Vite development server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes.

If you want to develop in a browser and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

### Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
